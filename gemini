I became a cash millionaire at 27 years old with software. But if I had to go back and make my first million dollars in the next 12 months with AI, this is exactly what I do. It's the same proven process that I took all my AI companies at Martell Ventures through over the last year. And three of those companies are already at a million dollars in revenue in less than 12 months. So, if you've been thinking about building an AI company or already have one and want to scale past the million, this video is your blueprint. Now, if at any point in this video you think to yourself, I can't do this, you might not be cut out to make a million with AI. But if you're one of the select few that are willing to do the work, this video is for you. Starting with step one, sell before you build. Let me tell you the fastest way to go broke with AI. Spend the next 6 months building a tool, then find out nobody wants it. You actually got to flip it. You need to sell it first, then build it. I call it pre-elling. Here's how it works. The first thing is we have to find 10 potential customers and ask them for advice. I'm going to give you the question to make this really easy. Because I learned a long time ago, if you talk to a potential customer and ask them for money, they'll just give you advice on why maybe you're not ready. But if you ask for advice, they give you feedback and then they sell themselves into buying from you. So the question you want to ask them is, what has been hard about your business that if you could automate with AI, you would love to get that set up for yourself, right? Just ask them those questions. And when they give you the answer, then you create the offer. Which brings us to step two. That's usually when people say, "Well, how much should I charge?" My rule is is whatever you would charge for the year, give them a 50% discount. And the reason you're giving the discount is because you're going to ask them for a case study. But what they're giving you in return is the permission to use their name to then use that when you go talk to other customers. And finally, you have to decrease the first time to value for your customer. Meaning, you have to build a plan that goes from like they gave you money to they got something as fast as possible. That's pre-selling and it's easier than you think. But now that you understand you have to pre-sell, how do you find the people to sell to? Which brings us to step two. Pick a boring market. I have a rule. I don't like to sell to hot, exciting, flashin the pan industries, things like marketing and technology, right? Crypto, ecom, course selling. And I'm not saying they're an absolute no. The problem is is that when you get into these shifts in fads, the fad could go away and you build a whole business against something that won't be there in three or four years. We have to pick a market that's easy to get into that's going to value innovation. It's like Jeff Bezos. He said, "Look, I don't care about what's new. I care about what's true. What are customers going to care about in 10 years, 20 years that's not going to change?" Because if you can find these boring markets that don't have a lot of competition, those are the ones that typically have high margins and they're ripe for disruption and innovation. So, how do you pick a boring market? Well, first ask AI. You can type, "Show me 20 boring industries with high average deal sizes where operations are still manual." Okay? Why? Because AI will help you automate those manual processes. See what I did there? And then the high deal size means that they're going to pay a lot, not too much, not too low because people that have money are great to sell to. So once you've got the boring market, how do you actually know what to sell? The second within that market, we got to find a pain that they actually have. So for an electrician, maybe it's the fact that they have missed calls that they're always getting and they're losing jobs because those calls are coming in after hours. See how that could be painful for somebody's trying not to be tied to their work or when they're working they're actually getting paid and they don't have time to answer a call. The third thing is we have to figure out the benefits that are needed. If the person has these problems, what are the key things that you're going to solve for them? So, for example, if it's that they're not available to take calls, then you can use an AI software like your Atlas and actually get paid to set it up for them so that it answer, it qualifies, and it schedules calls while they're on a job being an electrician. But you get paid by setting that up for them. See, the cool part is in this world we live in, you can make money using AI tools that other people built, but you're the person in the middle that sets it up for these business owners. By the way, I have links to all the tools I'm going to mention in this video below in the description, so you can click them if you want to check them out. But if I had to make a million dollars with AI this year, again, I wouldn't start with an idea. I would start with the boring market. So now that you know the market you want to be in, next we have to lock in the math that keeps you rich, not just busy. Step number three, pick your high margin model. Now margin is a weird word. A lot of people don't understand it, but it's very simple. If I sell a product for $5 and it cost me a dollar to make, my margin is $4. The challenge is most people focus on revenue and it's a vanity. How much money did you make last year? Oh, I made 100 grand. Well, if it cost you a million to make a h 100red grand, it's not a business you want to be in. And unfortunately, most people don't understand how to build the business in a way that can make them a lot of profit. And why AI is so powerful for this is that it can take your delivery costs where in the past you'd have to pay somebody to do it and bring it down to almost zero because AI can automate it. You want your AI business to feel like that high price, tiny cost. Charge a lot for what you do, very low cost to deliver. And look, I've done the research for you. So, here are the highest margin AI business models for 2026. The lowest one is AI services around 70% margin. Again, you can Google or search on AI any one of these. The next level up is AI consulting around 80% margins. Then we go to AI digital products around 90% margins. And then the one that I'm in and I love is AI software. A little bit more complicated to do and they have around 95% margins. where I spent personally 93% of my time all week building these companies. If I had to get rich with AI this year, here's what I would do. First, I would start with an AI service or consulting. That way, it gets me in the conversation with the customers. I learn the AI to automate, but then I would try to productize it into a light software that takes the workflow that I've documented, systematized, and packages it into a software that other people can buy without me even talking to them. That's how we get to 95% margin. So now we've got a boring market figured out and a high margin model so you can make some profit. Now you need to find the right person to sell it to. Step number four, create a high cash flow offer. Most people sell AI, but truth is nobody wants AI. A business wants customers. A business wants productivity. A business wants to reduce its cost. It doesn't care if that's AI or freaking a thousand people. As long as what they're paying and what they're getting, there's an ROI. Just so we're clear, margin is the profit potential. Cash flow is how the money flows through the business. For example, if I sell you a $1,000 solution that you buy from me, but then I got to put out $500 of my own money because by the time I send you an invoice and then your finance team gets it and they pay it, I got to put money out before I get money back. That's where cash flow is important. These are the four steps to avoid making the mistake of creating a cash flow crunch in your business before you even get started. The first thing we have to do is when we're selling, we have to sell one specific benefit. You can't try to sell anything they want. So, for example, if I'm selling to electricians, I'm saying that I can get them 10 more customers per week without answering a single phone call. See how that's one specific result or outcome. The second is we have to package our pricing so that we get paid as much as we can upfront before we incur any costs. So, for example, maybe your service you're selling is $1,000 for one month, but you might be willing to give them a discount if they go 6 months upfront and you give them a discount to $4,000. So, that first conversation and transaction is now four times more than the initial for 1 month, but you've committed for a longer term. The beautiful part of this is it reduce your potential churn, meaning customers that cancel and it increases the amount of cash in your bank account early and upfront. Then we have to implement scarcity because the truth is is we have to give people a reason to buy cuz if they won't, they'll just put on to-do list and think about it later. So I like to say that we're opening up 10 founding spots. After that, the price is going to go up cuz you say, "I only got 10 spots. I don't have all the time in the world. It's just me right now and I only have so much capacity." So you can use that to create scarcity and get the person to make a decision versus them just sitting on their hands and waiting. And lastly, we want to add a bonus so that we give them a reason to make a decision today. But the best bonuses kill objections. So for example, maybe they're like, "Hey, I want to do this, but I'm worried that my team doesn't have time to actually implement what you're selling." You say, "Cool." Well, because you're one of our first 10 customers, we actually have a bonus we want to add where we come in and we train your staff. Normally people are going to invest $5 to $10,000 to do that, but because you enrolled at the sixmonth level, we're going to do that for free. See how it's a bonus that deals with their objection. Do that every time and you will get more deals. If you want to get rich with AI or business in general, you just can't sell your hours. When you sell the result, then you're motivated to become more effective at getting the result. And anytime you can improve with automation or AI or training your staff better, the improvement you keep. And by the way, I spent years testing and tweaking offers until they converted fast. Then I turned it into a simple plug-and-play template. If you want my exact offer template that you can copy and paste for your AI business, find me on Instagram and DM me the words YouTube offer or just click the link below in the description. I'll send that over to you. Cool. So, you have an offer. Now what you need to build your product. Step number five, you have to build your AI MVP. So MVP stands for minimum viable product. Essentially, most people hear product and they think, "Oh, now I have to go hire a bunch of engineers and developers and build a bunch of stuff." And guess what? You don't. There's a bunch of tools you can use to build the product I'm going to teach you about in a second. But the idea is for it not to be perfect and not beautiful, but for that it just works. It's like this guy was talking to an event once. He was showing me his product, okay? Fancy, beautiful, mobile, all the bells and whistles. And I was like, "Well, how did you build it?" He's like, "I hired an agency and it cost me $100,000." And I'm like, "Cool. Is anybody using it? Customers yet?" "No, not yet." And I'm like, "You spent all your time on functionality to make it look good, but never asked, "Does it actually deliver value for the customer?" So, what I want to share with you is how to build an MVP that actually gets results, not just looks good. Best part is you only have three options. The last one's the most advanced, but it's where I spend most of my time. The first is a no code platform. When you look into these tools like a Zapier or a make.com or nadn essentially, you can take any manual process using AI and automate it. There's even tools like go high level that are CRM and funnel builders or things like lovable where you can just type to it and it'll build apps that solve problems for customers. The key is spend the least amount of time configuring your automation so that it gets a result for a customer. If you have to do it manually first so you just even learn the steps of how it needs to be automated. That's probably a better place to start than to just pay somebody to come in and build you something super custom and coded. The second option is to use an AI assisted code platform. What's called the Gentic programming. Those are tools like Replet or Cursor or Google's anti-gravity platform. It's not as simple as just prompting like a lovable, but it's way more configurable. Every one of my engineers in my venture studio uses one of these platforms to write the code. The third option is a hire an AI developer to build it for you. Now, most people get burned because they hire somebody. They say they can build the thing. They give them all their money and then all of a sudden the product they get back is crappy, buggy, or just doesn't work. The best way to test for this is if you're going to hire a developer, give them a tiny test project first. I like to look on upwork.com or call my local college. The key is is the MVP not only has to be simple, but it has to add value. If you don't show it to a customer and they go, "Oh, that's cool." Then it doesn't work yet. So now you have an MVP. your AI system works either through automation or custom code. But the next problem is if you don't automate the delivery after you sell a customer, you will drown in client work. Step number six, automate delivery. The biggest mistake that happens for entrepreneurs is not being prepared for success. One customer, no problem. Three customers, I can get it. Five to 10, now I have to use project management software. I have to have a support email, maybe a support phone call. And if you don't get ahead of it to automate it, that pressure can actually take you out of business. Here's my rule. Automation can turn your business into a machine, one that works while you sleep. So, here's how you map your four-step delivery system. First is the purchase, the moment somebody checks out. Okay? So, you're probably going to use Stripe to accept payment. That kicks off a notification. The second is once you get that purchase, okay, and you can do it manually or you can ask them to click a link and buy from you. that'll trigger access into your software or even into your community. My brother sells houses and as soon as somebody puts a deposit, it sends an email to add them to the project management software that the client's going to use to pick all the options for their custom home. So, it works for any industry. The third step is onboarding. Think I bought something. Now, what happens next? Well, ideally, you give them the software you just built or you might give them the ability to schedule some time with you so that they can schedule a review of how the software needs to be set up, right? and that whole process is automated. The fourth step is support. Think about all the questions that they're going to have for you. So, if you want to get rich this year, you can't be manually onboarding clients over time. You have to build a delivery system that feels like a vending machine and it's automated and it works every time. So, now you've done everything. You've got the business model, you got the product, you got the customers, you've automated your system. This is how we scale in 2026. But you have to be careful because if you're too greedy or worse, not greedy enough, it might be all for nothing. Which takes us to a hidden step that very few people consider. Step number seven, getting long-term greedy. A long time ago, one of my mentors, this guy named Steve, said there's two types of greed. There's short-term greedy, and then there's long-term greedy. Short-term greedy might get you what you want today, but it stops you from getting what you want long term. What he was trying to say is that I could ask for the investment terms I wanted today and people will pay for it, but then I'm going to have investors that I might not need for the long-term journey. Where he said, if I'm long-term greedy, then I'm going to give my investors the right terms to capture the right investors so they support me over the long term. You can only get rich this year by wanting to build an empire for the next 50 years. If you don't fall in love with the idea of making money over a long period of time, then your desire to find the flash in the pan will actually be your kryptonite. That's why being long-term greedy is always broken down into the three S's of wealth. The first S is sell. This is the skill you need to develop. You get your first client, you start to get the machine turning. Okay. The second S is scale. Once you get dozens of customers, then you have to scale it up. You have to tighten your systems, which stands for save yourself time, energy, money, and stress. You raise your prices because you're adding more value. You improve your offer. You work on your team. You get to a place where it almost feels easy. But that's where we go to the third S, which is stack. Once you have one machine working really well, which every business can get to a place where it's producing cash, you can now add other offers or other products on top of your service either through partnerships for things that you like or you build yourself or you could even buy other AI companies to sell into your existing customer base. That is the goal is to build an empire. It's to create a life of unlimited creation you never have to retire from. Most people that start businesses are very creative people and they think the bigger I get, the harder it's going to be. And the opposite actually happens at scale because the bigger you get, the more resources you have to invest in really smart people that are going to come in and help you co-create that future with you and make your life easier. So, here's the deal. Anybody watching this can do what I just shared. It doesn't require any special schooling or a trust fund or anything. You just have to talk to customers. But what it will teach you along the way is to strive to become your 10.0 self, the best version of yourself. That is one way of being successful. But if you want to live a life of fulfillment, yes, 10.0 self is what you're after. But the other side of that is to give yourself away. Share your strategies with the world like I'm doing here. Now, I don't want you to just watch this. I want you to do something with it. So find me on Instagram and DM me the words YouTube offer and grab my template. Build an offer that you can start selling this week. Find the customers, ask the questions, be curious, but I need you to win this year. 2026 is your year. AI is still early and the companies are out there waiting for your call. And if you want to learn the nine highinccome AI skills you need to get rich, click the link and I'll see you on the other

Strategischer Bericht: Pre-Selling-Architektur für KI-SaaS im Jahr 2026 – Synthese aus Dan Martells Methodik und algorithmischen TrendsExecutive SummaryDer vorliegende Bericht bietet eine erschöpfende Analyse und operative Roadmap für die Markteinführung eines KI-basierten Software-Systems (SaaS) unter Nutzung der Plattform TikTok im Prognosejahr 2026. Basierend auf der Analyse von Dan Martells unternehmerischen Philosophien 1, den spezifischen "Building in Public"-Strategien 3 und den algorithmischen Vorhersagen für TikTok 5, wurde ein detaillierter Pre-Selling-Plan entwickelt.Das Ziel dieses Dokuments ist es, die Diskrepanz zwischen der technischen Entwicklung (im "Gemini"-Fenster) und der kommerziellen Validierung zu schließen. Es wird argumentiert, dass im Jahr 2026 die traditionelle Marketing-Hochglanzästhetik durch "Reali-TEA" – eine radikale, fast schmerzhafte Authentizität – ersetzt wird.5 Erfolg im Pre-Selling korreliert nicht mehr mit dem polierten Endprodukt, sondern mit der Fähigkeit, den Prozess des Erschaffens als narrative Reise zu inszenieren.Die Analyse der Transkripte von Dan Martell liefert dabei die psychologische Basis: Der Übergang vom "Hustler" zum "Architekten" durch das "Zurückkaufen von Zeit" (Buy Back Your Time). Diese Philosophie dient nicht nur als interne Motivation, sondern als primärer Marketing-Hook, um das zu verkaufende System als unverzichtbares Werkzeug zur Erreichung ebenjener Freiheit zu positionieren.1. Die psychologische Architektur des Erfolgs: Analyse der Dan Martell TranskripteUm effektive "Hooks" für TikTok zu generieren, ist es unerlässlich, die tieferliegenden Narrative zu verstehen, die Dan Martells Lehren so resonant machen. Die vorliegenden Forschungsdaten 1 deuten darauf hin, dass es sich hierbei nicht um reine Geschäftstaktik handelt, sondern um eine fundamentale Identitätstransformation.1.1 Das "Replacement Ladder" Prinzip als Narrativer KernEin zentraler Aspekt, der in den Transkripten hervorgehoben wird, ist die sogenannte "Replacement Ladder" (Ersetzungsleiter).2 Martell argumentiert, dass Unternehmer scheitern, weil sie in der falschen Reihenfolge einstellen.Die Hierarchie der DelegationDie Daten legen nahe, dass die meisten Gründer intuitiv versuchen, zuerst "Sales" einzustellen, um mehr Geld zu verdienen. Martell korrigiert diesen Irrglauben:Administrative Assistenz: Um den Kalender und die Inbox zu bereinigen.Delivery (Erfüllung): Um den Gründer aus der operativen Arbeit zu nehmen.Sales (Vertrieb): Um den Umsatz zu automatisieren.Marketing: Als letzter Schritt zur Skalierung.2Strategische Implikation für das Pre-Selling:Für das vom Nutzer entwickelte System (vermutlich ein KI-Workflow oder Agent im Gemini-Kontext) bedeutet dies eine massive Positionierungschance. Das Produkt sollte nicht als "noch ein Tool" vermarktet werden, sondern als der digitale Mitarbeiter, der die erste Sprosse der Leiter erklimmt.Insight: Wenn das System E-Mails schreibt oder Prozesse automatisiert, ist es de facto der "Administrative Assistant", den sich der junge Gründer noch nicht leisten kann.Hook-Potenzial: "Dan Martell sagt, du brauchst eine Assistentin. Dein Bankkonto sagt Nein. Mein Gemini-Code sagt Ja."1.2 Trauma als Kapital: Die "End-of-Conversation" AnalyseDer Nutzer fragte explizit: "Was sagt er in der Transcription noch?" und bezog sich auf das Ende des Gesprächs. Die Analyse von 2 zeigt, dass Martell gegen Ende oft auf die tieferen, emotionalen Treiber eingeht: "Why your worst trauma sits right next to your life's purpose" (Warum dein schlimmstes Trauma direkt neben deiner Lebensaufgabe sitzt).Die Transmutation von Schmerz in ProduktivitätMartell berichtet von seiner Zeit im Gefängnis und in der Entzugsklinik mit 17 Jahren, wo ein Computer sein Leben rettete.2 Diese Narrative ist entscheidend. Er positioniert Obsession (eine Eigenschaft von Sucht) nicht als Fehler, sondern als Feature, wenn sie auf das Coden und Business-Building umgeleitet wird.Anwendung auf die Content-Strategie:Für die TikTok-Beiträge bedeutet dies, dass "Perfektion" vermieden werden muss. Die Geschichte des "Builds" muss den Schmerz des Scheiterns beinhalten.Konzept: Wenn der Nutzer im Gemini-Fenster einen Fehler im Code findet, ist das kein "Bug", sondern "Trauma", das überwunden wird. Das Resonanzfeld für 2026 verlangt diese Ehrlichkeit ("Reali-TEA").6Narrativ: "Ich habe 12 Stunden an diesem Skript gesessen und wollte alles löschen. Aber Martell sagt, Obsession ist eine Gabe. Also bin ich geblieben. Hier ist das Ergebnis."1.3 Martell Ventures und das Portfolio-DenkenGegen Ende des Gesprächs in 2 wird erwähnt, dass Martell jeden Monat eine neue Firma gründet ("Martell Ventures"). Dies impliziert eine extreme Systematisierung. Er baut nicht mehr selbst; er orchestriert.Zweite Ordnung Insight:Das Ziel des Nutzers beim Pre-Selling sollte es sein, dem Publikum nicht nur eine Software zu verkaufen, sondern das Gefühl, auch zum Orchestrator zu werden. Das System, das gebaut wird, ist der Schlüssel, um vom "Arbeiter" zum "Portfolio-Manager" zu werden. Die Hooks müssen dieses Aspirational-Level ansprechen: "Willst du ewig Coden oder willst du Firmen besitzen?"2. Die digitale Landschaft 2026: Algorithmische Trends und "Reali-TEA"Eine erfolgreiche Kampagne auf TikTok im Jahr 2026 erfordert eine präzise Ausrichtung auf die prognostizierten Trends.5 Die Ära des passiven Konsums endet; die Ära der aktiven Entdeckung beginnt.2.1 Trend-Signal: Reali-TEA (Das Ende der Fassade)Die TikTok-Trendberichte für 2026 5 identifizieren "Reali-TEA" als dominanten kulturellen Vektor. "Fantasy is fading" – die Fantasie verblasst. Nutzer sind der "Delulu"-Kultur (delusional) überdrüssig und suchen nach Bodenhaftung ("Grounding").Operative Umsetzung für den SaaS-BuildDies ist die wichtigste Variable für den visuellen Stil der TikTok-Beiträge.Kein Studio: Videos sollten am Schreibtisch aufgenommen werden, idealerweise mit schlechter Beleuchtung oder Chaos im Hintergrund. Das signalisiert: "Ich arbeite wirklich."Der "Glitch" als Vertrauensbeweis: Wenn im Video ein Fehler passiert oder der Nutzer stottert, sollte dies nicht herausgeschnitten werden. In einer Welt von KI-generierten Avataren ist menschliche Unvollkommenheit das ultimative Gütesiegel.8Textur der Realität: Die Kamera sollte den Bildschirm abfilmen (Handheld), anstatt nur saubere Screen-Recordings zu verwenden. Das physische Abfilmen des Monitors erzeugt eine dokumentarische Ästhetik, die unterbewusst Wahrheit signalisiert.2.2 Trend-Signal: Curiosity Detours (Neugier-Umwege)Nutzer auf TikTok befinden sich laut 5 im "Discovery Mode". Sie nutzen die Plattform wie eine Suchmaschine, um ihren Interessen (Curiosity Detours) zu folgen. Sie erwarten einen "Emotional ROI" – eine emotionale Rendite für ihre investierte Zeit.Implikation für Hooks:Ein Hook darf nicht nur Aufmerksamkeit erregen (Clickbait); er muss ein Wissens-Gap öffnen, das sofortige Relevanz verspricht.Schlecht: "Schau dir mein neues Tool an." (Werbung)Gut (Curiosity Detour): "Ich habe herausgefunden, wie Dan Martell seine E-Mails in 4 Sekunden beantwortet, ohne zu tippen. Der Code dafür ist illegal einfach." (Entdeckung)2.3 Trend-Signal: Brand Fusion und CommunityDie Berichte 9 betonen "Brand Fusion" und das Setzen auf kleine Communities ("Bet big on small communities" 6).Strategische Ausrichtung:Anstatt zu versuchen, "Jeden" zu erreichen, sollte der Content hyper-spezifisch für "SaaS-Gründer", "No-Code-Entwickler" oder "Burnout-gefährdete Agenturinhaber" sein. Die Sprache (Jargon) dient als Filter. Wer "Churn", "MRR" oder "API" nicht versteht, gehört nicht zur Zielgruppe. Das Ausschlussverfahren stärkt die Bindung zur Kernzielgruppe.3. Pre-Selling-Strategie: "Building in Public" (Öffentliches Bauen)Das Konzept des "Building in Public" (BIP) wird in den Forschungsdaten 3 als einer der effektivsten Go-To-Market-Strategien für B2B-SaaS identifiziert. Es transformiert die Produktentwicklung in eine Reality-Show.3.1 Die Taxonomie der viralen BIP-HooksBasierend auf 3 lassen sich spezifische Kategorien von Inhalten identifizieren, die eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit für Viralität besitzen:Hook-ArchetypBeschreibungPsychologischer TriggerQuelleDer "F* Up"**Das Teilen eines gravierenden Fehlers oder Rückschlags.Schadenfreude & Empathie: Menschen wollen sehen, dass auch Experten scheitern ("Reali-TEA").3Der Umsatz-StripteaseDas Offenlegen exakter Zahlen (auch $0).Voyeurismus: Geld ist das letzte Tabu. Das Brechen dieses Tabus schafft sofortiges Vertrauen.4Der "Industrie-Beef"Widerspruch gegen einen etablierten Guru oder Standard.Tribalismus: "Wir gegen Die". Polarisation fördert die algorithmische Verbreitung durch Kommentare.3Das "Feature-Leak""Ich sollte das eigentlich noch nicht zeigen..."Exklusivität: Das Gefühl, Insider-Wissen zu erhalten (Curiosity Detour).103.2 Die Trichter-Mechanik (Funnel)Der TikTok-Beitrag ist nur der Einstieg. Um echtes Pre-Selling zu betreiben, muss der Traffic konvertiert werden.Phase 1: Awareness (Der Hook): Stoppt das Scrollen.Phase 2: Consideration (Die Demo): Zeigt das Gemini-Fenster und die Lösung.Phase 3: Action (Der CTA): "Kommentiere 'SYSTEM' für Wartelisten-Zugang."Automatisierungs-Hinweis:Da die manuelle Bearbeitung von Kommentaren bei einem viralen Hit unmöglich ist, sollte ein DM-Automation-Tool (wie ManyChat) eingesetzt werden. Dies spiegelt auch Martells Philosophie der Automatisierung wider.4. Content Engineering: Hooks und Skripte (Die Kernanforderung)Basierend auf der Synthese aus Martells Philosophie ("Buy Back Time", "Trauma") und den 2026er TikTok-Trends ("Reali-TEA"), folgen hier die spezifischen Skripte. Diese sind darauf ausgelegt, per Text-to-Speech (Voice) oder eigener Stimme vertont zu werden.Strategische RegieanweisungVisueller Aufbau: Split-Screen oder Green-Screen.Hintergrund: Das Gemini-Fenster (Code/Chat), in dem das System live "gebaut" wird. Es muss Bewegung zu sehen sein (tippender Text, generierter Code).Vordergrund/Overlay: Der Nutzer oder dynamische Captions.Audio: Schnelles Pacing.

Technische Implementierung und Risiko-AnalyseDie Forschungsdaten zu E-Commerce und TikTok Shop 12 scheinen auf den ersten Blick irrelevant für SaaS, enthalten aber kritische Warnungen für den Vertrieb digitaler Güter.5.1 Die "Supply Chain" des Vertrauens13 warnt vor "Produktqualitäts-Inkonsistenz" als Hauptgrund für das Scheitern auf TikTok.Transfer auf SaaS: Im Pre-Selling existiert das Produkt oft noch nicht final. Dies birgt das Risiko, als "Scam" wahrgenommen zu werden.Mitigation (Risikominderung): Die "Reali-TEA"-Strategie wirkt hier als Impfung. Indem man offen kommuniziert, dass das System "in Entwicklung" (Beta) ist, senkt man die Erwartungshaltung an Perfektion und erhöht die Toleranz für Fehler. Das Produkt ist nicht die Software, sondern die Teilhabe an der Entwicklung.5.2 Algorithmische Gefahren15 diskutiert das Problem: "TikTok Ad Clicks No Sales" (Klicks aber keine Verkäufe).Ursache: Diskrepanz zwischen der "Ad" (dem Video) und der Landing Page.Lösung: Die Landing Page für das Pre-Selling muss die gleiche Ästhetik haben wie das TikTok-Video. Keine Hochglanz-Webseite, sondern eine schlichte Notion-Seite oder ein einfaches Typeform. Dies erhält die "Curiosity Detour" aufrecht und bricht nicht den psychologischen Rahmen.5.3 Die Rolle der Plattform "Kinso"In 2 wird "Kinso" erwähnt, ein Tool, das Antworten im eigenen Tonfall entwirft.Insight: Dies ist ein Meta-Thema. Der Nutzer sollte erwähnen, dass er solche Technologien nutzt oder baut. Es beweist, dass er am Puls der Zeit ist ("Dogfooding" – das eigene Futter essen).6. Synthese und Strategischer AusblickDie Integration der analysierten Daten führt zu einer klaren Roadmap für den Nutzer. Das Pre-Selling eines KI-Tools im Jahr 2026 erfordert eine Abkehr vom klassischen "Verkaufs-Pitch" hin zum "Dokumentations-Pitch".6.1 Die "Gemini"-RealitätDer Nutzer erwähnte: "in der gemini un in der anderen siehst du was wir hier bauen". Dies ist das stärkste Asset.Strategie: Der Bildschirm ist die Bühne. Der Code ist der Protagonist.Umsetzung: Jedes Video sollte zu mindestens 50% den Bildschirm zeigen. Dies befriedigt den voyeuristischen Drang der Zuschauer ("Was baut er da?") und liefert den Beweis der Arbeit ("Proof of Work").6.2 Martells "Belief Collector" als Community-Tool7 nennt das Konzept des "Belief Collector".Anwendung: Der Nutzer sollte seine Community bitten, ihm "Glaubenssätze" zu schicken, die das System testen soll. "Glaubst du, man kann Kaltakquise nicht automatisieren? Lass es uns testen." Dies involviert die Zuschauer direkt in die Entwicklung (Interaktive Produktentwicklung).6.3 Zusammenfassung der AnforderungenDer Nutzer forderte:Hooks & TikTok Beiträge: Geliefert in Kapitel 4 (4 detaillierte Skripte).Verständnis des Gesprächsendes: Integriert in Kapitel 1.2 (Trauma & Martell Ventures).Neugier wecken: Durch "Curiosity Detours" und offene Loops in den Skripten (z.B. "Der eine Satz, den alle überhören").Pre-Selling Fokus: Durch klare CTAs ("Warteliste", "Beta-Test") in jedem Skript.6.4 FazitDer Erfolg dieser Kampagne hängt nicht von der technischen Überlegenheit des Gemini-Codes ab, sondern von der Fähigkeit des Nutzers, die "Hustle"-Müdigkeit der Zielgruppe (Trend 2026) mit der "System"-Lösung von Dan Martell zu beantworten. Die Videos müssen als "Rettungsring" in einem Meer von Überforderung positioniert werden. Der Nutzer verkauft keine Software; er verkauft "Zeit".Anhang: Detaillierte Datenanalyse und QuellenverzeichnisHinweis: Dieser Abschnitt dient der internen Referenzierung der verwendeten Forschungs-Snippets innerhalb der narrativen Struktur.Analyse der Quellen-ClusterDan Martell Philosophie: 1 – Fokus auf Mindset, Trauma, Replacement Ladder.Taktische Umsetzung (AI Solopreneur): 11 – Liam Ottley liefert die konkreten Schritte ($0-$10k), die das Tool automatisieren soll.TikTok Trends 2026: 5 – Liefern den ästhetischen Rahmen ("Reali-TEA").Building in Public: 3 – Liefern die Mechanik für Viralität ohne Werbebudget.Risiken: 12 – Warnen vor Qualitätsmängeln und Vertrauensverlust.Diese Synthese stellt sicher, dass jede Handlungsempfehlung im Bericht datengestützt und zukunftssicher ist.

I know for a fact that you're tired of searching the internet for the best ways to make money online. Every day, thousands of internet gurus tell you to try affiliate marketing or drop shipping, and they're all full of Those things don't work in 2026, especially not in the new era of AI. In my AI venture studio, Martell Ventures, I've created dozens of companies that now generate millions, and I can tell you there's only a few real ways to make money online. To make it simple, we're breaking everything into four buckets. Trash, the stuff you shoulding run away from. Easy, businesses you can launch in under three months, earning 5 to 10K a month. Medium, skills that can be profitable within a year, making 10 to 50K a month. And hard, long-term plays that may take more time, but can make you millions if done right. I'll tell you the income potential, difficulty, how long it'll take to make money, and who is best for each bucket. So, without further explanation, let's get into the real ways to make money in 2026. [music] Starting with bucket number one, the trash bucket. The income potential for this bucket is zero or even worse, could be negative. Difficulty, I mean, it looks easy, but it gives you nothing back. time frame wastes months [music] before you realize it was dead on arrival. Who is it best for? No one. NFT flipping. The hype is freaking done. Look at all the projects that launched. Nobody made money. The ones that thought they made money have lost money. And if you're going to start there and you haven't made money ever online, that's a losing recipe. Next, crypto trading moves really fast. Most people don't have the patience and it's [music] without any crazy skill. Unless you're the person that tries to frontr run the whole freaking trade, most people lose money every freaking day. Next, multi-level marketing. If the way you make money is getting paid to recruit people to join your thing and you don't shape the business and you don't actually sell anything and you actually spend more money to buy product to try to get up the leaderboard, that's not a business you want to be in. Most of these are scams. Next, basic caption or subtitles. [music] Now, AI does it faster, cheaper, and way better. After that, we have low-level data entry. This is wild to watch that people still think they're going to make money on this because AI tools have replaced this work completely. Fiverr Microtask, my favorite website on the internet 5 years ago. Trying to make money this way. It's not the worst on the list, but it has zero long-term growth. Next, we got print ondemand. Here's the thing, it's really crowded and everyone sells the same stuff. And last but not least, my favorite, day trading. Here's the deal. If you're not completely into it, obsessed on it, and just want to just live the day trading life, it is way easier to lose money than to make any. Basically, all these are like trying to race across the ocean in a car. [music] You keep drowning because you need a different vehicle. So, to make sure your idea isn't in this bucket, I need you to run your idea through the trash filter. Three simple questions. One, is AI already replacing this? Two, is the industry shrinking or going obsolete? Three, is it easier to lose money than to make money? If you answer yes to any, move on immediately. Now, let's talk about the first bucket that actually pays real money. Bucket number two, easy bucket. The income potential, 5 to 10k a month, no problem. The difficulty, low, simple skills, fast turnaround. Time frame, 30 to 60 days to actually get paid. And it's best for beginners trying to gain some momentum and build some skills. You don't need a degree for these. These just need basic execution and learning how to talk to customers. Just get your first dollar online. Build some confidence and learn how clients work. Here are some examples. The first one, basic short form editing. If you haven't seen all the people that have like these clipping accounts and people like edit these short form videos all over social media, I mean, the demand is [music] huge. Every person now seems to be a content creator and AI makes it incredibly easy. So, it's easy to get paid fast. Love this one. [music] Next, we got social media copywriting. Every business in the world needs to learn how to use words to get customers to buy and they need somebody to help them. And the tools are getting so good. Just get the client, do the work, get paid. Next, we've got the AI chatbot setup for small businesses. I love this one because every small business needs more time back. And if you can be the person that comes in and help them set this up, they will pay you money because it's easy for them to redeploy their time to make more money than what they paid you. use this one. Next, we've got the AI receptionist. Along those same lines, it's crazy today when you can use tools like your.com that you can get paid to set up for small businesses to take all the inbound calls to qualify, [music] sell, fill up schedules, answer questions, and it'll do it without being upset, complain, take time off, or call in sick. Helping businesses do this is a great way to make money. Next, we've got UGC content. Brands want to pay for real people showing their products, not professional models. Helping a brand connect with a creator and you're the middleman and you get a piece of this. My buddy in Dubai, this is his whole business and they're already doing 100K [music] a month. So, you can make 5 to 10 starting with this one. And last, the virtual or executive assistant. It's one of my fave categories cuz I wrote a book called Buy Back Your Time. See, rich people hate wasting time and they'll pay you to get it back. The best part is you get paid to hang out with smart people that can teach you about life to help them get done. Nob brainer. A great example of this bucket is my buddy Mark. No background, no experience. He decides to start approaching companies to help them take long form content that they were creating using AI to break it down into short form clips. And that simple process of using AI tools, making it repeatable, and turning around really quick has scaled now. Whereas a freelancer, he earns $30,000 a month with only seven clients. This bucket is about learning how to master a high income skill. Because if you already knew how to make millions, you'd be making millions. Which means you're going to have to invest in yourself to develop the skills to add value to the world. If you want to try any of these ideas, follow these specific [music] steps. First, create your outcomebased offer. Don't sell your time. Map to a pain the customer already has. help them make money or save time around an area that they're really in pain around because pain is a perfect way to figure out what they're willing to pay for. Make a promise that's specific around a result in a very specific time frame. That's how you create a compelling offer and then just remove all the risks. Just tell them what the guarantee is and then say, "Because it's just you, [music] you can only take so many clients, so I'm only looking for three or five clients." That creates urgency and it'll get them to buy right away. And for what it's worth, if you [music] want to make this super easy, I can send you my exact offer template. So, all you have to do is copy and paste it. It'll save you hours of tweaking and adjusting and testing. Just DM me the [music] words YouTube offer on Instagram or click the link in the description below and I'll send it over. So, once you have your offer, just do one daily outreach. That's a non-negotiable. If you want to make money online, set it and forget it. It's just a habit. So, reach out to one potential client every day until you get customers. But you just have to have a clear offer. That's what this bucket will teach you. That skill of crafting an offer, getting somebody to understand it, and paying you. [music] This will get you the best chance to be successful in this bucket. That being said, if you already have experience [music] or you want income that's more consistent, the medium bucket might actually be better choice. Bucket number three, the medium bucket. Essentially, the income potential is 10 to 50K per month minimum. Difficulty level, it's medium, but multi-kill work tied to real business outcomes makes you money. You're not just doing task anymore. You're solving revenue and growth problems for businesses. And the time frame to make real money could be 3 months, maybe worst case 12 months, but you're setting up your future. And it's best for people that have some skill but want more stability and scale. When I look at Sam on my media team, Sam didn't ask for a step-by-step instruction to be successful. He just framed the outcome. He took ownership and he delivered. Because of that, he got opportunities to step up. That's why you've probably seen the video of me giving him his dream car, a Porsche GT4. It wasn't because he was doing little tiny tasks. [music] It's because he actually delivered the outcome. And for me, that became vastly more valuable. And that's what's different about this bucket. You're no longer just doing the skill. You're actually tying your pay to an outcome. The only way for your clients to make more money is for them to focus on solving bigger problems which mean you come in and take the smaller [music] problems off their plate. So what are some examples in this category? The first one automation agencies. This one's the new hotness. Why? The demand for this alone makes it a fantastic opportunity and it makes you bulletproof for the future. businesses are literally drowning in opportunity to automate and it makes them money quickly and it saves them time at scale and it's going to futureproof [music] you for other companies. Next, we got LinkedIn growth systems powered by AI. Every CEO or leader out there, they need more reach. They need people to know who they are. They need people to know, like, and trust them. And if you're the kind of person to come in and own that outcome of getting that attention, that audience, that trust, [music] they will pay you to help them grow. Next, we've got micro SASS, near and dear to my heart, and really AI tools for small businesses. These are like really small, tiny tools that help save people time. So, you can have like a plugin, an extension, an app for a marketplace, [music] but the cool part is you charge monthly for simple, clear value, and that's how you stack revenue. Next, we've got an AI content agency. This one is super fun, especially if you love content. I mean, brands are always looking for more content that's aligned to help them create associations [music] to help their business. So, you use AI to produce high volumes without shooting. It's crazy. So, look into like Hey Genen, 11 Labs, and other tools like that that'll make this job easy. And for these last two options, just take a screenshot for all the AI tools that I put up on screen so that you can make this option way easier. And last, we have highquality motion graphic [music] designers. The more AI can do all kind of lowquality stuff and like people are shooting more and more content. What's missing is somebody to understand how to do motion graphics. This is the separator. This is where you make content [music] look pro. So you want to learn After Effects plus all the AI tools that help you make and deliver premium assets fast. And for these last two options, take a screenshot of all these AI tools that will make it so much easier for you. If you fall in love with this bucket, here are two pro tips that you need. One, build three to five measurable case studies that you can tell to other people. That way, it'll allow you to sell to more clients fast. So, if you're just starting off, maybe you find people that represent your ideal customer profile and offer to either do it at a discount or free. I don't love free, but let's say discount. And in return for that discount, they agree to let you use their project as a case study to talk to other customers about. Two, sell outcomebased monthly retainers instead of one-off projects. I still see people in today's age that are selling their time for [music] money. You have to disconnect from that. Don't get stuck in it. Don't start there. Don't get in the trap. When you can sell outcomes, especially like monthly retainers for a specific outcome, that creates predictability and reoccurring revenue in your business. And that is the most beautiful place to get. And that is how you make real money online. But if you want to build something way bigger than yourself, something that could actually [music] change your entire life, the hard bucket is where it's at. Bucket number four, the hard bucket. The income potential here could be like a million plus a month. Honestly, millions. The difficulty level though is high cuz it's going to require systems, leadership, and honestly long-term thinking. It's hard to get into and it may need some capital or expertise, but you will see a massive return. And the time frame to get to this level, if you start from zero, could take two to 10 years or more, depending on your level of effort. It's best for people who want to build something bigger than themselves. Essentially, an asset or even better, an empire. [music] And the reason why is because you're building something that someone else might actually buy. The people in this bucket are my kind of people. So, let's run through some examples. The first, [music] investing in AI first founders. This is my world. See, back in the day, I've been doing AI investing for over seven years. Companies like Flex Pay or Intercom, etc. These are all companies I was involved in in the early days. And what's cool about it is that if you have the capital and you invest in them, when they win, you win. When you get equity without running the company yourself, you get a lot of time back. So, this is a great way to create leverage and create an empire. I've personally invested in over a 100 companies using this method. And starting from 2026, this is going to get way bigger. A lot of people are going to be able to do this one. Next, we got software AI products. Essentially, this is my world. This is what I build at Martell Ventures. We have built or partnered with people that have launched a new AI company every month for the last year and a little bit. And I'm telling you, this one has made me more money than anything I've ever done my whole life. The key to make it work is you got to build tools that solve real problems in a way that's unique. Most of the applications that I'm working on, honestly, the AI [music] isn't powerful enough yet for it to work. Not only is it a great way to generate reoccurring revenue because it's software, but you build some value where people will pay you 10 [music] to 50 times more than your topline revenue for the business. Next is buying small businesses and using AI to automate 30 to 50% of it. It's so crazy how there's like these really simple businesses that are still stuck in the 80s. My friend Jason bought a campground a couple years ago and all he did was put in AI powered booking software, management software, maintenance software, and the thing prints cash today, but buying a boring business that somebody else is done with using AI is a great way to create real wealth. Next, we've got personal brand or content machine for deal flow. I break it into content and commerce. You've seen this with Mr. Beast and Feastables. You've seen this with Logan Paul and Prime. You've seen [music] this with all these content creators. But if you can build a personal brand, build distribution, then you have a way to introduce customers to a product that creates equity, that creates enterprise value, and this is in the hard bucket because most people are willing to stick with it. It takes time. It takes commitment. It takes dedication. You got to be consistent. Most people would rather take the easy way. That's why it's in the hard bucket. Next, we've got subscription communities powered by AI curation. I've seen so many of these online communities now where essentially people pay every month to be part of a group so that they have access to knowledge and experience and the AI is designed to answer their questions to support them. It's faster, it's easier, and you can build a business from it. And last, licensing AI playbooks. This is where most companies don't realize their system prompts is their new IP, their intellectual property. So, if you have a business that has created these playbooks that are AI powered, you can copy paste those and sell them to other businesses by making them passive income. Like, just go look at all the custom GPTs you can buy. A lot of people are like creating innovation inside their own business and licing it to other companies [music] and making a ton of money. This is a really cool one that I think a lot of people are sleeping on. The hard bucket is near and dear to my heart because it's a reflection of my life. I mean, a lot of people see me today and they see all the success and the accolades, but they don't know where I started. I started as a software programmer at 17 writing code and it took me almost seven years to finally find any software any traction what I was doing and eventually at 28 I sold my company and I became a multi-millionaire and it's the thing that ultimately made me financially successful but better than anything it created the confidence in my abilities that I could then apply to my other companies. So don't forget you don't get the hockey stick without the flat first year. So, you have to learn how to invest and reinvest and recommmit if you ever want to be successful. Here's [snorts] how you do this for yourself step by step. One, tie your strongest skill to a fast growing industry. If you don't know what that is, ask AI. It'll tell you. Second is systematize your service. Don't sell your time. Sell an outcome so that you can build the system around delivering that outcome and create automation so it's systematized. Third is build a small team slowly. Surround yourself with killers. I believe the first 12 people that come into your business will dictate your success. You want to be slow on making sure they're the right fit for what you're trying to do. And for what it's worth, avoid adding headcount where AI could do the job for you. Number four, layer AI into your operations to increase your margins. Get rid of the cost. Get AI to build that automation. And last, use content to create inbound deal flow. If I would have known when I started creating content that not only would bring opportunities to me, but it would bring talent, it would bring friendships, it would bring invites to things that you couldn't even pay for, I would have started a long time ago. So, no matter what you decide to do in this bucket, just make sure you create content around it. None of this matters. If you fall into the trap that destroys more businesses than anything else, the shiny object syndrome. Most people fail not because they were in the wrong bucket, but because they switch buckets every few weeks. I got a friend, he's the same age as me. I've watched him go from like one idea to the other idea to the next idea to another idea, and he hasn't found any traction. Why? He keeps resetting every time. Every 2 or 3 years, it's like, "Oh, that didn't work cuz of this. I'm going to do this now." Here's why. When you start from scratch, you can't be wrong. If you stick long enough with something it doesn't work, then it can feel demoralizing. But the real way to win is to stay in the game long enough to win. See, winners lose more than losers by definition of being a winner. I know it sounds crazy, but that's what it's going to take. So, don't get distracted. Focus. Follow one course until successful. Pick one of these options out of these buckets and execute. Just remember, you can do anything, just not everything. So, here's how you avoid the shiny object syndrome. One, commit to a,000 days of focus. Don't stop. Be consistent. Two, document [music] the journey. Put it in public. Build in public. It'll actually hold you accountable because everybody's going to be waiting to see what you're going to post next. If you just do these two things, it'll increase your probability of success more than anything else you could do. And the most important thing is that you commit. Don't just hear all of this and do nothing. The separator in 2026 is the people that show up and do. And those are the folks that make it this far. So, if that's you, I want a commitment. Type commitment below. Look me in the eyes and let me know you're one of the people that are different. You're the one that's not just going to do shelf help, listen to a lot of stuff, and put it up on a shelf, but you're actually going to focus until you get results. And remember, if any of you are entrepreneurs out there and you want my exact offer template to help you get clients, just DM me the word YouTube offer on Instagram or click the link below and I'll send it right over.
